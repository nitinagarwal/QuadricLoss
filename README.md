# MeshCNN in PyTorch


### SIGGRAPH 2019 [[Paper]](https://bit.ly/meshcnn) [[Project Page]](https://ranahanocka.github.io/MeshCNN/)<br>

MeshCNN is a general-purpose deep neural network for 3D triangular meshes, which can be used for tasks such as 3D
shape classification or segmentation. This framework includes convolution, pooling and unpooling layers which are
applied directly on the mesh edges.

The code was written by [Rana Hanocka](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~hanocka/) and [Amir Hertz](http://pxcm.org/) with
support from [Noa Fish](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~noafish/).

# Getting Started

### Installation
- Clone this repo:
``bash
git clone https://github.com/ranahanocka/MeshCNN.git
cd MeshCNN
``
- Install dependencies: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) version 1.0 (also works with 0.4+). <i> Optional </i>:
[tensorboardX](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX) for training plots.
  - Via new conda environment `conda env create -f environment.yml` (creates an environment called meshcnn)
      
### 3D Shape Classification on SHREC
    Download the dataset
    ``bash
    bash ./scripts/shrec/get_data.sh
    ``
    
    Run training (if using conda env first activate env e.g. ``source activate meshcnn``)
    ``bash
    bash ./scripts/shrec/train.sh
    ``
    
    To view the training loss plots, in another terminal run ``tensorboard --logdir runs`` and click
    [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).
    
    Run test and export the intermediate pooled meshes:
    ``bash
    bash ./scripts/shrec/test.sh
    ``
    
    Visualize the network-learned edge collapses:
    ``bash
    bash ./scripts/shrec/view.sh
    ``
    
    An example of collapses for a mesh:
    
    <img src="/docs/imgs/T252.png" width="450px"/> 
    
    Note, you can also get pre-trained weights using bash ``./scripts/shrec/get_pretrained.sh``. 
    
    In order to use the pre-trained weights, run ``train.sh`` which will compute and save the mean / standard
    deviation of the training data. 
    
    
### 3D Shape Segmentation on Humans
    The same as above, to download the dataset / run train / get pretrained / run test / view
    ``bash
    bash ./scripts/human_seg/get_data.sh
    bash ./scripts/human_seg/train.sh
    bash ./scripts/human_seg/get_pretrained.sh
    bash ./scripts/human_seg/test.sh
    bash ./scripts/human_seg/view.sh
    ``
    
    Some segmentation result examples:
    
    <img src="/docs/imgs/shrec__10_0.png" height="150px"/> <img src="/docs/imgs/shrec__14_0.png" height="150px"/> <img
    src="/docs/imgs/shrec__2_0.png" height="150px"/> 
    
### Additional Datasets
    The same scripts also exist for COSEG segmentation in ``scripts/coseg_seg`` and cubes classification in
    ``scripts/cubes``.
